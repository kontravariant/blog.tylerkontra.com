## Misinterpreting Their Future
I had the distinct pleasure of reading an article from the Harvard Business Review on the growing presence of millennials in the workforce and their impact on hiring practices and people management. It's titled [Research: Millennials Can't Afford To Job Hop.](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-millennials-cant-afford-to-job-hop)

The article starts with a line that legitimately got my attention, which I wasn't expecting.

> Millennials are probably the most maligned generation yet to enter the workforce.

It was surprisingly honest, and surprisingly forthright, especially on a conservative publication such as HBR. It acknowledges such sentiments as

>[Millennails are] portrayed as disloyal job hoppers —  self-involved idealists demanding a steady diet of recognition and raises. In short, a human resources nightmare, right?

It then refutes that with some contrived statistics from a [Center for Talent Innovation study](http://www.talentinnovation.org/). Statistics trying to exhibit how most millennials *don't* have a financial safety net, i.e. a family to support them if they lose their job.

Now my issue isn't with the article itself, but with the issues it discusses, and the logic they are rooted in, and *especially* the responses current managers come up with (including the article author).

## Children
The article continues to explore how current managers handle Millennial employees.
>Most companies act as if their Millennials have one foot out the door. “Can you get these kids to stay?” challenged the global talent head of a multinational consultancy.

(Now, I have to point out that a pseudonym is used here to obscure the 'global talent head's name, while companies are named later. This inclines me to believe the quote is from someone at the authors consultancy, Hewlett.)

I don't know how managers expect anyone under 30 to take them seriously when they refer to their *employees* who are *fully grown and educated adults* as children. These children are 24 or older (by the definition of millennials given in the article). This would be a great place to start if managers want a better response from millennials.

>In short, even as HR professionals recognize Millennials as their next workforce, they see no reason to groom them for leadership until they start acting, sounding, and looking like previous generations.

This is where I really started to get disillusioned. Again, the author is not at fault for pointing out these mindsets, the mindset of an entire *generation* of (current) managerial staff.

Just so we're on the same page: managers want an entire generation of individuals, individuals who have been, for their entire lives, connected to a staggering amount of information via the internet, to simply conform and become their ancestors?

That makes so little sense it is almost impressive, since this is the opinion of managers who are running the companies that are the proverbial fuel of our (unavoidably gobalized, but that's a different article) economy.

## Use It or Lose It
> And if leadership development (typically reserved for high-potential talent) and cross-generational interaction are withheld from Millennials, then the imminent exodus of Boomers threatens to pull decades of institutional knowledge and market expertise out the door with them.

This is a powerful statement, and I applaud the authors for proffering it. It's a shame to think most managers reading the article will have stopped reading at this point or skipped to the "advice" section (oh boy will we get to that).

As far as I know, outside of tech startups, most established corporations select a handful of promising (read: foreign or exceptionally intelligent American) recent graduates to process them through MBA programs or leadership camps. These are the future chief executives. But the middle management, still entrenched in Baby Boomer values, will remain solidly Boomer, and there will be an abrupt and painful transfer of power when the elders retire and the young people (notice I didn't say kids) are thrust into leadership without any preparation. Perhaps change is needed? (That's a rhetorical question, for the HR people reading).

## Nuance? Little Late For That.

But the fun part of the article starts when the author suggests managers must utilize *nuance* of the millennial outlook to *connect* with them like some sort of crystal ball.

> Create a forum for cross-generational communication.

Wonderful idea, single out the millennials simply for being young and surround them with everyone senior to them who fear they are going to steal their jobs anyway.

> Show them how to create value.

Yes, millennials have absolutely zero clue how to create value for an organization. We didn't go to the same educational institutions our employers did. We absolutely must have instant feedback, and token "applause awards" sent to coddle and pamper us.

> Help them craft their ideal work environment.

This I do not have as much a problem with. But it suggests specifics such as learning opportunities and then drops the idea entirely. Perhaps acknowledge millennials desire for work-life balance (flex hours, amenities on corporate campus, etc).

I hate to copy a whole paragraph but:

>Companies that dismiss Millennials until they “grow up” are ignoring demographic reality. They already have grown up. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, Millennials now represent 34% of the U.S. workforce, outnumbering both Gen Xers and Baby Boomers. And the numbers will only increase.

I applaud the authors for that. An obvious observation, but from what we've seen it looks like Boomers need facts thrown in their face like they think we need praise thrown in ours.

## Work Zone Ahead

Now the authors seem to contradict themselves and offer my final point on their own:

>The smartest thing forward-thinking companies can do is to stop treating Millennials as if they are an alien species and at least listen to, if not embrace, their ideas and professional desires.

This is exactly what I was going to say, and counters their three suggestions about how to coddle millennials in the workplace. I would sum it up thusly:

**Let millennials do their jobs.**

How radical is that?

I'll admit I left a comment on the article before writing this post, and I'll excerpt it here:

> Show us how to create value? Create a forum? How about treating us like every employee you've had prior, and mold us the same way if molding is what you wish to achieve.

Instead of worrying about how millennials will never provide value and never live up to their parents work ethic, put them in roles where they *can* provide value to the organization instead of their boss.

Stop coddling and start working. Twenty years from now you won't be around to coddle, and millennials will be running your companies. Let it happen, or your company won't be around it all, and perhaps that will negatively affect the markets, and with it your retirement funds. Seems like that fact gets forgotten.

Everything has consequence.
