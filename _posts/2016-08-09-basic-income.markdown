title: The Future of Income

# Odd Era, Low Expectations
In an election cycle that I've been told is the most bizarre in US history, it can be tough to find productive, insightful conversation. I like yelling over others as much as the next guy (read: congressman), but there's something about *point--counter-point* discourse  that draws me in. I'd consider myself a conversationalist, but lately I've had to lower my expectations significantly in terms of the conservations I might find.
The other day, however, during a rare intellectual conversation around a camp fire, my friends and I discussed the current state of politics in America (and by extension, the World; we're millennials and we recognize globalization is inevitable). The conversation eventually turned to the concept of a **basic income** or compulsory stipend for citizens. We discussed how much it might be, if it might be implemented in our lifetime, and what its impact might be.

# If It Helps...
The overarching idea of [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) is the notion that civilization has advanced to the point where manual labor is generally accomplished through automation or machine-aid. Humans are less and less required to perform mundane tasks in order to survive (farming, cooking, etc.). The general theory continues to explain that technology will keep advancing to replace more and more of the human workforce (manufacturing, service, etc.) and the tip-top high-tech firms will be the only human-run enterprises left. But their market will shrink as more humans are unemployed, and do not have income to spend on their high-tech products or services. Thus, a compulsory income is required to ensure the existence of consumers, but it can go much deeper than that.

## How about me?
There are many proponents of basic income with different views. Feminists like the ability to ensure financial independence of women, while conservatives see it as a replacement for welfare. Leftists identify it as a method of wealth distribution. Everyone has their own opinion on it, so let's see who's right.

## Techno Babel
Everyone loves to speculate about the end of manual labor. Robotic manufacturing, self-driving cars, computerized fast-food cashiers (yes please). But what about when there simply aren't enough jobs for everyone: there simply wouldn't be enough demand to warrant enough jobs. Everyone goes on welfare? Why not basic income? This could allow automation to expand unfettered by humanists. Lose your job to a machine? Here's $20,000 for the next 12 months. On welfare already? Here's $20,000, probably more than the benefits than you received last year.

## Make It Work
Welfare spending (including health care) totals $1 trillion USD per year. That may sound like a lot, but divided amongst 200 million adult Americans, that's only about $4500. Altogether, the US Budget is $3.8 trillion, only enough for $12,500 per person per year. Obviously there would have to be some sort of financial magic utilized to make this feasible, but let's pretend for the moment that it could. How could it change our lives?

## Don't Have It? Don't Need It?
Those on welfare could continue to purchase bare necessities, and those in the middle class could supplement their income. Some might choose to quit working, after all, their savings supplemented by $20k a year might let them retire 15 years early. Then, younger adults making only the compulsory $20k a year could fill in their old positions and begin their careers. Millionaires and billionaires could donate their $20,000 to charity, and receive tax credits. Those previously at the poverty line would receive a decent bump and many more could afford to attend college (likely state college, but college nonetheless). College costs would no doubt increase from this increased demand, but many more would still gain access in the end. This investment in human capital would breed a more technical, capable workforce, and we'd likely realize gains in standard of living. But what about those people that retired early? Or those that decided 20 is enough?

## Humanity!
The struggling artist would no longer be struggling. She'd be comfortable if she works part time at the coffee shop, much more comfortable than before. She might be able to devote much more of her time to art, and the world might experience the next Picasso, that we might not otherwise would have, if Picasso was stuck mopping aisle 7.

## "All I See Is Possibilities"
A basic income has not seen widespread institutional implementation anywhere in the world. A Swiss referendum back in June (2016) was voted down by 77%. German Parliament investigated such a proposal in depth and they found: (from Wikipedia)
* The consequences of de-motivated workers were too unpredictable
* Immigration would spike
* Taxation, social security would have to be restructured
* Financing was not found possible

So clearly it's difficult.
# Where To Go From Here?
There's nowhere to go, really. It's a fascinating concept, with fascinating possibilities but it just doesn't seem feasible right now. I, for one, am in favor of it, even with its logistical impossibilities. The impact it could have on economics is largely unknown, and reasoning through its consequences is exhilarating yet tiresome, there are so many variables and so much at stake. But, at a time that seems so do-or-die, so very visceral. we can't help but think that any well-intentioned change should be considered to best extent we can muster.
