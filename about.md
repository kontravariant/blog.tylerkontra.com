Hi, glad you managed to find my blog. I never thought I'd write a blog, to be quite honest, but I'm glad I've started.

I mainly work on random statistical analyses and model-building in my free time (really exciting stuff, I know). So I decided it might be fun to post my methodologies and findings here, work on my communication skills, etc.

But I also realized I have a lot of thoughts that I keep in my head. I thought, hey maybe I should try formulating these thoughts into coherent arguments, and write them down. Then, they are already written down, so why not post them? So, I'll post them. Feel free to leave comments!
