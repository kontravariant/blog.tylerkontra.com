# Odd Era, Low Expectations
In an election cycle that I've been told is the most bizarre in US history, it can be tough to find productive, insightful conversation. I like yelling over others as much as the next guy (read: congressman), but there's something about *point--counter-point* discourse  that draws me in. I'd consider myself a conversationalist, but lately I've had to lower my expectations significantly in terms of the conservations I might find.
The other day, however, during a rare intellectual conversation around a camp fire, my friends and I discussed the current state of politics in America (and by extension, the World; we're millennials and we recognize globalization is inevitable). The conversation eventually turned to the concept of a **basic income** or compulsory stipend for citizens. We discussed how much it might be, if it might be implemented in our lifetime, and what its impact might be.
